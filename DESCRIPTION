Description: An R interface for Rho's 'web-codebook' 'JavaScript' charting library, which provides a simple interactive framework for exploring data. 'datadigest' includes two key functions (codebook() and explorer()) that deliver a concise summary of every variable in a data frame, along with interactive features such as real-time filters, grouping, and highlighting. Each function has an associated 'RStudio' addin/'Shiny' app for quick and convenient exploration of one or more data frames.
