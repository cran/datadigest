\description{
The \code{datadigest} package provides a simple interactive framework for exploring data.  
The package serves as an R interface for Rho's \code{web-codebook} 
JavaScript library. This tool provides a concise summary of every variable in a data frame and 
includes interactive features such as real-time filters, grouping, and highlighting. 
The R interface allows the analyst to interactively explore datasets within the typical 
analysis workflow and working environment.  
\code{datadigest} has been built using the \code{htmlwidgets} framework.
